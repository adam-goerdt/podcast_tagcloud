# Podcast Tagcloud Project

This is an experamental project to attempt to see if it's possible to use tag clouds to find common topics that influential IT Security people are discussing.

We'll use NiFi to grab rss feeds for popular security podcasts, look for transcripts if available, and split the content of the podcasts into words to use as the base of a tag cloud.
